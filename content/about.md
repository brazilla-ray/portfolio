I'm an [artist](https://williamwhitaker.art) and aspiring web-developer. The biggest difference between the two is testing. You can write tests for code, you can't write tests for paintings. Code succeeds when it does what you expect it to do, paintings succeed when...they succeed? There isn't a straightforward answer to the question of what makes a painting work or not work.  
` `  
But just because code is quantifiable doesn't mean that it doesn't require creativity, just as painting's subjectivity doesn't mean there's no logic to it. Both involve managing the relationships between parts, and that's where creativity and logic merge. Navigating that complexity is what makes both painting and coding so rewarding.

I've been teaching myself how to code for the better part of ten years now. It started because I needed a website to showcase my artwork. The more I've learned along the way, the more I've wanted to learn. So that's what I've been doing. I'm currently working my way through courses on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/beginner/) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/brazilla-ray), improving my JavaScript skills, and learning about Vue and Nuxt.
` `  
I'm always looking for new challenges. If there's something you think I can help with, let me [know](https://williamwhitaker.dev/contact)!

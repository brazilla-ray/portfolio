# about me  
` `  
I first got into web development because I needed a website for my [artistic practice](https://williamwhitaker.art). I started out coding a basic site with static HTML and CSS. Since then, I've built sites with Drupal, Ruby on Rails, Node, Angular, WordPress, and, most recently, Nuxt/Vue. Along the way, I've learned to use Git, Vim, Docker, and other command-line tools.  
` `  
I love learning new things, solving problems, and facing new challenges. Right now, I'm working my way through some courses on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) and [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). I've never made a dime from building a website(not that I'm opposed...); it's the sheer joy of learning that keeps me coming back.

# portfolio

## This is the code for my portfolio site, [https://williamwhitaker.dev](https://williamwhitaker.dev)

It's built with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/), and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
